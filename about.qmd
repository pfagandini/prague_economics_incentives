title: "About the Instructor"
---

I am Paulo Fagandini, and I will be the instructor of this course. I have a doctorate in Economics from Nova School of Business and Economics, where I did my dissertation on Applied Microeconomic Theory, working in Contracts, Matching, and Auctions.

After that I did a postdoc in Corporate Finance at Nova Finance Center, where I worked doing empirical research.

Nowadays, I currently teach Mathematics at the doctoral and master level at Nova SBE, and Microeconomics and Statistics at the Polytechnic University of Lisbon. I also teach Economics at the Universidade Europeia, also in Lisbon.

I have published articles in journals like Managerial and Decision Economics, and Computational Economics, chapters on peer reviewed books, and I worked recently as co-editor in a book about agent based models. I have done peer reviews for several scientific publications.
