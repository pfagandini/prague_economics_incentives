I have a doctorate in Economics from Nova School of Business and Economics, where I did my dissertation on Applied Microeconomic Theory, working in Contracts, Matching, and Auctions.\nAfter that I did a postdoc in Corporate Finance at Nova Finance Center, where I worked doing empirical research.\nNowadays, I currently teach Mathematics at the doctoral and master level at Nova SBE, and Microeconomics and Statistics at the Polytechnic University of Lisbon. I also teach Economics at the Universidade Europeia, also in Lisbon.\nI have published articles in journals like Managerial and Decision Economics, and Computational Economics, chapters on peer reviewed books, and I worked recently as co-editor in a book about agent based models. I have done peer reviews for several scientific publications."

The \\(DA\\) speaks to each prisoner separately, and tells them that she more or less has the evidence to convict them but they could make her work a little easier (and help themselves) if they confess to the crime. She offers each of them the following deal: “Confess to the crime, turn a witness for the State, and implicate the ohter guy, and you will do no time. Of course, your confession will be worth a lot less if the other guy confesses as well. I that case, you both go in for 5 years. If you do not confess, however, be aware that we will nail you with the other guy’s confession, and then you will do fifteen years. In the event that I cannot get a confession from either of you, I have enough evidence to put you both away for a year.”\n\n\nPrajit K.
